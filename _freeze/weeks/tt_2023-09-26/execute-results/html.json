Particularly in early seasons, he's a man of few words, but many of them are f**k, expressed in various moods - mad, sad, happy, amused, loving, surprised, thoughtful, and joyous.\n\nThis dataset includes the number, percentage, and context of f**k used in the show for each episode.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Load the weekly data and check the [readme](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/tt_year/2023-09-26)\n\n\n\n\n# Analyse\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n",
