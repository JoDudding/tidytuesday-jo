    "text": "This week we’re exploring monsters from the Dungeons & Dragons System Reference Document! After the popularity of our Dungeons and Dragons Spells (2024), we thought it might be fun to explore the freely available monsters from the 2024 update.\n\nEvery monster is a font of adventure. In this bestiary of Dungeons & Dragons monsters, you’ll discover the weird, the whimsical, the majestic, and the macabre. Choose your favorites, and make them part of your D&D play.\n\n\nWhich types of monsters have the highest (or lowest) of each ability score?\nWhich monster types have a broad range of challenger ratings?\nWhich language allows your character to communicate with the most monsters?\nHow else can the dataset be processed to pull out common fields?"
