    "text": "This week we’re exploring the water quality of Sydney’s iconic beaches. The data is available at the New South Wales State Government Beachwatch website.\n\nBeachwatch and our partners monitor water quality at swim sites to ensure that recreational water environments are managed as safely as possible so that as many people as possible can benefit from using the water.\n\nSydney beaches were in the news this summer with high rainfall causing concerns about the safety of the water.\nThe dataset this week includes both water quality and historical weather data from 1991 until 2025.\n\nHas the water quality declined over this period?\nHow does rainfall impact E-coli bacteria levels?\nAre some swimming sites particularly prone to high bacteria levels following rain?"

    "text": "Background\nFor Deepsha Menghani’s talk on Data Viz animation and interactivity in Quarto, she watched each episode of Ted Lasso at 2X speed and diligently noted down every F*bomb and gesture reference, and then made it into the richmondway R package!\nWhat is Ted Lasso and who is Roy Kent?\nTed Lasso is a TV show that “follows Ted Lasso, an American college football coach who is hired to coach an English soccer team with the secret intention that his inexperience will lead it to failure, but whose folksy, optimistic leadership proves unexpectedly successful.”\nRoy Kent is one of the main characters who goes from captain of AFC Richmond to one of the coaches. Particularly in early seasons, he’s a man of few words, but many of them are f**k, expressed in various moods - mad, sad, happy, amused, loving, surprised, thoughtful, and joyous.\nThis dataset includes the number, percentage, and context of f**k used in the show for each episode.\n\n\nLoad the weekly data and check the readme\n\n\nAnalyse"
