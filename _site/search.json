    "text": "This week we’re exploring the water quality of Sydney’s iconic beaches. The data is available at the New South Wales State Government Beachwatch website.\n\nBeachwatch and our partners monitor water quality at swim sites to ensure that recreational water environments are managed as safely as possible so that as many people as possible can benefit from using the water.\n\nSydney beaches were in the news this summer with high rainfall causing concerns about the safety of the water.\nThe dataset this week includes both water quality and historical weather data from 1991 until 2025.\n\nHas the water quality declined over this period?\nHow does rainfall impact E-coli bacteria levels?\nAre some swimming sites particularly prone to high bacteria levels following rain?"
